To set up Swagger in a Go project using the Gin web framework and
 handle a simple HTTP request, you can follow these steps:

go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get -u github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger
go get -u github.com/swaggo/files
go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag


Use swag init to generate Swagger documentation.
Run this command in the root of your project:
swag init

4. Write Code with Swagger Annotations

5. Add Swagger Annotations
In the code above, the comments just above the SimpleRequest
function are Swagger annotations that define how the API documentation
should be generated. For instance:

@Summary: A brief description of the endpoint.
@Description: A more detailed explanation.
@Tags: Categories for the API endpoints.
@Success: What a successful response looks like.
@Router: Defines the path and method (GET, POST, etc.).

swag init
go run main.go
http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
